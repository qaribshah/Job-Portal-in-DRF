## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

This project follows a modular, microservices-inspired architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- `api`: Core API gateway, routing, and central configuration
- `jobs`: Comprehensive job posting and management system
- `applicants`: Advanced applicant profiles with skill matching
- `applications`: Full-featured application processing pipeline
- `employees`: Employee management for corporate users
- `accounts`: Enterprise-grade authentication system
- `resumes`: Secure document storage with parsing capabilities

Each module is designed to scale independently and communicate through well-defined interfaces, ensuring maintainability and allowing for future expansion.

   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@example.com
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password
   EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
   
   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
   JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
   JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME=60 # in minutes
   JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME=7 # in days
   
   # Google OAuth
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   ```

5. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   cd job_portal_main
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## üîÑ API Endpoints

This API follows RESTful conventions with a comprehensive suite of endpoints:

### Authentication

- `POST /api/token/`: Obtain JWT tokens
- `POST /api/token/refresh/`: Refresh JWT tokens
- `POST /api/token/verify/`: Verify token validity
- `GET /accounts/google/login/`: Initiate Google OAuth login
- `GET /accounts/google/callback/`: Google OAuth callback URL

## üîç Advanced Filtering

The API supports sophisticated filtering mechanisms:

### Job Filtering
```
/jobs/?job_title=Software Engineer&location=New York&min_salary=80000&skills=python,django
```

### Applicant Filtering
```
/applicants/?name=John&email=john@example.com&contact=123456789
```

## üìÑ Pagination

API responses are paginated for better performance:

```
/jobs/?page=2&jobs_per_page=20
```

Results include comprehensive metadata:
```json
{
  "count": 135,
  "next": "https://api.example.com/jobs/?page=3",
  "previous": "https://api.example.com/jobs/?page=1",
  "results": [...]
}
```

## üîê Authentication

The system implements a secure authentication approach:

### JWT Authentication
API endpoints require authentication with JWT tokens.

Include the JWT token in the header of your requests:
```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Google OAuth Authentication

Users can authenticate using their Google accounts, providing a seamless and secure login experience:

1. Users are redirected to Google for authentication
2. Upon successful authentication, they are redirected back to the application
3. A JWT token is issued for subsequent API calls

### Token Lifecycle

- Access tokens expire after the configured lifetime (default: 60 minutes)
- Refresh tokens allow obtaining new access tokens

### Permission Levels

- Anonymous: Limited to public job listings
- Applicants: Access to own profile and applications
- Employers: Access to own company, jobs, and received applications
- Admins: Full access to all resources

## üß™ Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run specific test modules

**Note**: Before running the application, ensure you have created a `.env` file with all required credentials as shown in the setup instructions, especially your Google OAuth credentials for social authentication. The `.env` file contains sensitive information and should never be committed to version control.
